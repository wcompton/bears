            <h2 class = "sections">The Early Years</h2>
       
    <p>The franchise that became the Bears was founded by businessman 
        A.E. Staley in 1920 and was first known as the Decatur (Illinois) Staleys. 
        George Halas became player-coach of the new team, which he 
        relocated to Chicago in 1921 after Staley handed the young franchise 
        over to him. (Halas, affectionately known as “Papa Bear,” prowled the 
        sidelines as head coach until 1968.) The team won the American 
        Professional Football Association (APFA) championship in its first 
        season in Chicago, and it was renamed the Bears in 1922, the same 
        year the APFA became the NFL.The early Chicago teams established a 
        rivalry with the Green Bay Packers, which became one of the sport’s 
        most storied feuds. Led by a dominant rushing attack that featured 
        future Hall of Fame backs Red Grange and Bronko Nagurski, the Bears 
        captured NFL championships in 1932 and 1933, the former of which was 
        won in the first play-off game in league history, a 9–0 victory over 
        the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans. In the 1940s the Bears won four more 
        championships (1940, 1941, 1943, 1946), largely because of the efforts 
        of quarterback Sid Luckman, a future member of the Hall of Fame. The 
        innovative T-formation offense that Luckman ran, which utilized two 
        running backs and set men in motion before the play, was an immediate 
        sensation and became the dominant offense in the NFL.</p>
        <h2 class = "sections">The mid 1900's</h2>
    <p>The Bears won another title in 1963 and drafted two all-time greats
        in 1965: linebacker Dick Butkus and running back Gale Sayers. While 
        Butkus and Sayers went on to dominate the game on an individual level, 
        the Bears did not advance to the play-offs during either of their careers. 
        The dry spell ended when the Bears drafted running back Walter Payton in 
        1975, starting a decade of dominance. Payton went on to break Jim Brown’s 
        record for all-time rushing yards (which was in turn broken by Emmitt Smith 
        in 2002) and was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993. Behind 
        Payton the Bears won four division titles and their only Super Bowl (1985). 
        Led by head coach Mike Ditka, a larger-than-life personality who had starred 
        as a tight end for the Bears of the 1960s, and iconoclastic quarterback Jim 
        McMahon (the “punky QB”), the 1985 Bears team was especially noteworthy for 
        its overpowering defense that—after serving as the catalyst for a 15–1 
        regular-season record—allowed only 10 total points in the team’s three 
        postseason games. The team became a national sensation with the release of 
        “The Super Bowl Shuffle,” a rap song (and accompanying music video) that 
        featured members of the team boasting of going to the Super Bowl, which was 
        confidently released before the end of the regular season.</p>
            <h2 class = "sections">1990's and 2000's</h2>
        <p>The Bears experienced limited success in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, 
            but they advanced to the Super Bowl in 2006, where they lost to the 
            Indianapolis Colts. Following the 2010 regular season, the Bears returned 
            to the NFC championship game, where they were defeated by their rivals the 
            Green Bay Packers</p>
            <h2 class = "sections">2011 to current</h2>    
        <p>The Bears muddled through the following four seasons without making the play-offs, 
            and in 2013 and 2014 they reached a nadir for a team that prides itself on its 
            historical “Monsters of the Midway” defensive reputation: Chicago allowed the two 
            largest opponents’ point totals in franchise history during those seasons. While 
            the team’s defense improved in the following two seasons, the Bears nevertheless 
            remained one of the worst teams in the NFL. In 2016 Chicago posted a 3–13 record,
            which equaled a team record for most losses in a season.After four consecutive 
            seasons of double-digit losses, the team hired Matt Nagy as head coach in 2018. 
            Nagy guided the team to a seven-win improvement in his first season at the helm, 
            leading Chicago to a division title that was followed by a narrow loss in the team’s 
            opening play-off game.</p>
